In Wedding Photography, I strive to document the event as if I were not there, trying not to interfere, just let it happen, capture the moments and the atmosphere on black &amp; white film or digital sensor. This reportage style will give you a very different and intriguing look on your wedding day, a look that you will cherish for a lifetime and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
Before the wedding day, I meet the couple one or two times, to get to know each other a bit, talk, take some pictures and as a result break the eventual ice and "camera shyness".
    </p>
    <p>
My photographic tools consist of 2 Leica film cameras, 1 Leica Leica camera and some prime Leica lenses as well as two medium format cameras, Hasselblad SWC/M and Rolleiflex 2.8 TLR.
    </p>
    <p>
The resulting wedding album is usually designed and edited by myself in colloboration with you.
    </p>
    <p>
For Film Photography (analogue), I develop and enlarge the negatives by myself or, depending on the circumstances, I entrust work to the darkroom specialist I've been working with for the last 4 years here in Hiroshima.
I offer different qualities of paper (RC paper or Baryte paper) and different sizes for such analogue print.
    </p>
    <p>
For Digital Photography, the prints are made in a professional digital print labo also in Hiroshima. Of course, a Digital Book is also possible.
