    <p class="welcome">
Welcome to my website.
    </p>
    <p>
Through these pages of my photographs, I want to give you an impression of how I see the world we live in. I want to show the world to you without interfering in the situation nor changing the atmosphere of that moment that I try to capture.
    </p>
    <p>
In order to do this, I adapt my techniques and have some tool preferences. For example I do not use a flash, and thus leave the light as it is. I use an unobtrusive compact camera system, which is the sublime Leica M film and digital camera system. It is backed up with a mirror-less Hasselblad SWC camera and a Rolleiflex TLR camera for some slower images. My favorite and main medium is black and white film, as this complements my reportage style in wedding and street photography. For landscape and nature I often use positive film (Slide or reversal film). Of course, I also make digital pictures and for the wedding assignments the customer can request a digital, and/or negative black and white photo reportage.

    <p>
I was born in Valencia, Spain in 1966 and spent my childhood there, as well as in Bornem, in the Flemish speaking part of Belgium. Having seen my father making baskets and my mother making leather accessories for a living, I have developed a special relationship with handcrafts and feel very attracted to all kinds of art such as architecture, painting, furniture design, interior and car design, leather crafts, wood crafts, and cooking!
    </p>
    <p>
In 2009, I graduated in Photography (Post graduate degree) at SISA in Antwerp, Belgium. After having spent many years in Belgium and some time in Barcelona I moved to Hiroshima in 2009, where my main activity has been wedding and maternity photography as well as street photography. I regularly attend photography seminars as I am convinced that there is always something new to learn out there.
    </p>
    <p>
In Hiroshima, I am an active member of two very dynamic photography groups that regularly organize photo exhibitions and, in May 2014, I had my first solo exhibition <a href="exhibitions.html">Impressions</a>. Some of the "Impressions" pictures, mainly from negative film, are still for sale on Barite paper (Fiber Paper).
There are also some Fuijiprint paper photographs from my digital pictures on sale too.
You can read more about the upcoming exhibitions on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tonygaralg">Facebook page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
If you are interested in any of the pictures on the site, I kindly suggest that you contact me via <a href="mailto:tgaralg@gmail.com">e-mail</a>.
I certainly hope that you enjoy the pictures, and maybe we will meet at one of the exhibitions or expresso coffee events.
