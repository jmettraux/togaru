    <p class="welcome">
Welcome to my website,
    </p>
    <p>
through these pages, I want to give you an impression about how I see the world in which we are living.
I want to show it to you without interfering in the situation nor changing the atmosphere of that moment that I try to capture.
    </p>

I therefore adapt my techniques and have some tool preferences. For example, I don't use flash light in order to leave the light as it is. I use an unobtrusive compact camera system which is the sublime Leica M film and digital camera system, backed up with a mirrorless Hasselblad SWC camera and Rolleiflex TLR camera for some "slower" images.
My favorite and main medium is black &amp; white film  which complements my reportage style in wedding photography and in street photography. For landscape and nature, I often use positive film (slide or reversal film).
Of course, I also make digital pictures and for the wedding assignments the customer can ask me both digital and/or negative black &amp; white photo reportage.

I was born in Valencia, Espa√±a in 1966 and spent my childhood partly in Valencia and mainly in Bornem (Flemish talking area in Nord Belgium).
Having seen my father making baskets and my mother making leather accessories for a living, I have developed a special relation with handcrafts and feel very attracted to all kind of art like architecture, painting, furniture design, interior design, car design, leather crafts, wood crafts, ... and cooking!!

In 2009, I graduated in Photography (post graduate degree) at SISA in Antwerpen Belgium.
After having spent many years in Belgium and some time in Barcelona, I moved to Hiroshima in 2009, where my main activity has been wedding and maternity photography and street photography.
I regularly attend photography seminars as I am convinced that there is always something that we learn out there.
    </p>
    <p>
In Hiroshima, I am an active member of two very dynamic photography groups that regularly organize photo exhibitions and, in May 2014, I had my first solo exhibition <a href="exhibitions.html">Impressions</a>. Some of the "Impressions" pictures , mainly from negative film, are still for sale on Barite paper (Fiber Paper). Some Fujiprint paper prints for the digital pictures are on sale too.
You can read more about the upcoming exhibitions on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tonygaralg">Facebook page</a>.

    <p>

I hope you enjoy the pictures, maybe we'll meet at one of the exhibitions or one of the expresso coffee events.
